# Bachus project
🚧 Work in Progress

This is a WIP RISC-V processor.
Currently only the M and F (partial) blocks are finished.

# Features
- The most efficient sg13g2⚡️🌿 adder*
- CocoTB testing suite🐍 (hope you like Python)
- Reinventing the wheel for the 2137th time 🟡
- Reusable modules 🔁
- PnP (plug and pray) extensions 🛐
- Horror and unspeakable crimes against digital design


*defined arbitrarily based on energy efficiency and how fast can LL run it on IHP-SG13G2 without hold time violations(so about 5ns).

## How do I use it?
You can either grab the project or grab its libraries based on what you need.

## Does it work?
Currently only the divisor has some minor bugs. Also the floating-point multiplier doesn't support subnormals yet.
So yeah miraculously it works, sometimes. Maybe.
